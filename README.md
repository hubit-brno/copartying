## CoPartying

Based on [3ree boilerplate](https://github.com/GordyD/3ree).

### 3rd party services

Initially, I set up foursquare and gmaps APIs on my own account, to experiment. We should look at this into more details (delegate API related accounts to the group). (volunteers?)
So for now, if you want to see the foursquare and map, you'd have to provide your own keys :/

`cp universal/3rdParty.example.js universal/3rdParty.js`

and then set your keys... These could be handled by deploy script or env vars later on (volunteers?)
